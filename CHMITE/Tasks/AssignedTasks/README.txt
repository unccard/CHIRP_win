This directory contains evaluation tasks assigned to listeners.  

Each "message" file represents an assignment of a subject's timestamp directory to a listener.  The file naming convention is task_CHMITE_listenerUID_subjectID_timestamp.csv.

Once the task has been completed by the listener, the "message" file is moved to the CompletedTasks directory.
